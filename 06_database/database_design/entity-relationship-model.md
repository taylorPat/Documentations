# Entity-Relationship-Model

A model that functions as a high level requirements document with a structure that can be understood and communicated by different people.

## Requirment

Requirements are the needs and expectations of stakeholders that define what a system must accomplish.

. In the context of an entity-relationship (ER) model, requirements are translated into entities (things of interest), attributes (properties of those things), and relationships (associations between entities).
